2022-4-7  v2.4.4.0W
1. Repair GTX 10XX, GTX 16XX, RTX 20XX, RTX 30XX all series graphics cards to increase computing power by 20%.
2. Due to the limitation of memory bandwidth, dual-channel DDR3 1333 frequency or higher frequency memory is required to fully utilize the computing power, and single-channel memory can only increase by 10/100.
3. Fix the compatibility with sm50, sm52, sm60, sm61, sm70, sm75, sm80, sm86 architecture graphics cards.
4. CUDA 11.1 version development, requires NVIDIA >=452.39 or above driver to use.
5. There are only so many graphics cards in my hands, and the improvement effect of other graphics cards needs to be tested by yourself. This is a major update and increase in computing power. It is recommended that every user upgrade to the latest version 2.4.4.0
6. The computing power is as follows:	
 		  
	 1060 6G  Single-channel DDR3 1333 frequency 9.8MH, under dual-channel, the computing power is expected to be 11.3MH
	 
	 1070 8G  Single-channel DDR3 1333 frequency 14.5MH, under dual-channel, the computing power is expected to be 16-16.5MH	  
	 
	 3070 8G 31.7MH
	 
	 2080 8G  Single-channel DDR3 1333 frequency 23.5MH, under dual-channel, the computing power is expected to be 25-26MH	
	 
Notice：All supported graphics cards will have a significant increase in computing power with dual-channel or multi-channel memory
